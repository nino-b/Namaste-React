# Namaste React - Learning Journey ðŸš€ðŸš€

Welcome to my learning journey through [Akshay Saini's](https://www.youtube.com/@akshaymarch7) ["Namaste React"](https://namastedev.com/learn/namaste-react) series! This repository serves as a central hub for all my assignments, notes, and the code snippets that were written during the lectures. The primary goal of this project is educational, aimed at both solidifying my understanding of React and sharing these insights with others who are on the same path.

## About 'Namaste React'

["Namaste React"](https://namastedev.com/learn/namaste-react) is a video series by [Akshay Saini](https://www.youtube.com/@akshaymarch7), aimed at demystifying React and its core principles. Covering everything from the basics to advanced topics, this series is a comprehensive resource for anyone looking to deepen their understanding of React.

## Repository Structure

The repository is structured to reflect the progression through the "Namaste React" series, with dedicated folders for assignments and notes corresponding to each episode. Here's how the content is organized:

- **`/assignments`**: This folder contains subfolders for each episode, each of which includes:
  - **`assignment.md`**: The assignment given at the end of the episode.
  - **`notes.md`**: My notes summarizing key points and learnings from the episode.
- **`app.js`**: The main JavaScript file for React concepts demonstrated in the series.
- **`index.html`**, **`index.css`**, and **`reset.css`**: Basic front-end files to run and test React code examples.

## How to Navigate This Repository

1. **Episode Assignments and Notes**: Navigate to the `/assignments` directory, select an episode's folder, and explore both the `assignment.md` and `notes.md` to get a comprehensive understanding of what was covered.
2. **Running Code Examples**: The root directory contains `app.js`, along with `index.html` and stylesheets, to help you run and test out React code examples discussed in the series.

## Contributing

While this project is primarily for my personal education, I'm open to contributions that can enhance the learning experience for others. If you have suggestions for additional resources, corrections, or any other improvements, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
