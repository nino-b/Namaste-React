# Why is state variable necessary? Can we use regular JS variables instead?

### Why do we have useState()?
### When do we use useState()?


When a <b>State Variable</b> is updated, it calls the component once again with new input (rendering it again). We declare a State Variable with ```const```. The reason how the State Variable gets a new value is that it gets declared again (with a new value), when the component is called again.
